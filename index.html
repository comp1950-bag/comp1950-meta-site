          <h2 class="my-4">Description and Rationale</h2>


          <p>The original website for the COMP 1950 is quite solid in terms of presentation of its content. However, it can be improved in order provide a better user experience over a variety of viewports and platforms. It should be comfortable to students access the content over a tablet, mobile phone, or even print the content according to their convenience.</p>

          <h2>Methodology</h2>
          <p>
          Gathered right in the classroom, the members this team believe in the potential of collaborative platforms to comfortably enhance productivity without bringing communication lacks to the project. We found this project a good opportunity to implement the GIT tools and get up to date with that incredible tool. There was created a user comp1950-bag, and all the commits and collaborations are available at https://github.com/comp1950-bag.
          </p>
          <p>
          The group had 3 face-to-face meetings, where was discussed the issues and better solutions according to the milestones. Between meetings, the communication was done by hangouts and e-mail.
          </p>

          <dl>
            <dt>Responsive Design</dt>
            <dd>For enhanced access to diverse screen sizes, it was chosen bootstrap, which easily implements responsive behaviour through javascript and CSS. After implementation, the team tested the user experience to validate all the modifications.</dd>
            <dt>Printing Design</dt>
            <dd> We are environmentally friendly, so we tried to save some trees cleaning off the menus and few design resources. Just what matters, just essential ink on the paper.</dd>
          </dl>

          <p>
          Our group have decided to make use of several modern web technologies and techniques to further improve the user experience of the current COMP 1950 website.
          </p>

          <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
          <dl>
              <dt>Bootstrap Framework</dt>
              <dd>Leverage the framework's ability to display responsive web pages and maintain consistency through the use of Themes & Templates. <br>We've chosen <a href="https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/sb-admin-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SB Admin 2</a> as the foundation for the new COMP 1950 website.</dd>
              <dt>Jquery</dt>
              <dd>Performs user input validation with dynamic data delivery and retrieval (JSON) which allows students to take their quizzes online.</dd>
          </dl>

          <h3>Techniques Applied:</h3>
          <dl>
              <dt>Security</dt>
              <dd>Implement client-side (JavaScript) and server-side (httpd.conf or .htaccess) configuration when handling user information and user friendly error messages (i.e "404 page not found").</dd>
              <dt>Search Engine Optimization</dt>
              <dd>Applied Google's SEO Guidelines and implement semantically structured web pages. Quizzes section are configured to turn away search engine bots to avoid appearing on online search results.</dd>
              <dt>Presentation</dt>
              <dd>Made use of a stylesheet reset and a separate printer friendly stylesheet.</dd>
              <dt>User Experience</dt>
              <dd>Includes familiar buttons and icons, notification displays, chat support, and accessibility features.</dd>

					- Mention Jquery/javascript -where/why
					- CSS3 - where/why
					- bootstrap 
					- printing/mobile design
					- metodology - meetings
						- mention github and links
					- SEO
				</p>
				<p>
					The original website for the COMP 1950 is quite solid in terms of presentation of its content. However, it can be improved in order provide a better user experience over a variety of viewports and platforms. It should be confortable to students access the content over tablet, mobile phone, or even print the content according to their convenience.
				</p>

				<h2>Responsive Design</h2> 
				
				<p>
					For enhanced access over diverse screen sizes it was chosen bootstrap, which easily implements  responsive behavior trhough javascript and CSS. After implementation the team tested the user experience to validate all the modifications. Starting from a template, it was necessary to modify :

				</p>

				<p style="color:red;" >
					- offsets for navbar?
					- padding, content size?
				</p>
				<h2>Printing Design</h2>		
				<p>
					We are environmental friendly, so we tried to save some trees cleaning off the menus and few design resources. Just what matters, just essential ink on the paper.<a style="color:red;"> mention what  was exactly done</a>
				</p>
			
				
				<p style="color:red;" >
					A description and rationale for all site improvements. This is among the most important sections of the project meta site. This is your chance to 'sell' your efforts to your client instructor. This is	where you describe why you chose to build the site in the way you have proposed. List all the deliverables you have implemented, and and any features or improvements you have added.
					Justify your decisions for choosing a particular layout and design. If your HTML5 improves the
					page semantics and thus SEO, be sure to mention it. If you used jQuery or CSS3, explain where it is being used, and why. Also List any features you had planned to implement but could not
					complete. If your rationale does not describe a sufficient quantity of improvements, and if it
					does not effectively make a case for how these changes improve the site, your client will not be convinced that your team is the best choice.
